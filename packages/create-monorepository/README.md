## create-monorepository

Just a simple tool for creating a monorepository.

## Background

In our daily development, we may often need to create projects repeatedly. At the same time, we need to configure eslint, stylelint, typescript, commitlint repeatedly, which is boring. So, I created this tool to free myself from this repetitive and boring work.

## Usage

```
npx create-monorepository my-awesome-project
```

Then you will be asked some questions about your project, select answer and hit enter to go on.
