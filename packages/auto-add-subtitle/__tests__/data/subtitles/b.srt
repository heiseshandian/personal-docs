1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:03,200
The idea is our smart.

2
00:00:03,200 --> 00:00:08,200
Avatar is a stateful component so it can hold some state

3
00:00:08,900 --> 00:00:14,500
it can it can be responsible for counting the API and we'll

4
00:00:14,500 --> 00:00:17,000
do that in its lifecycle hooks, right?

5
00:00:19,300 --> 00:00:25,000
So the with after URL should return a smart Avatar itself.

6
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:26,400
In this case.

7
00:00:26,600 --> 00:00:28,300
We use objects in tanks.

8
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:32,400
The first thing we do is instead of accepting source as a

9
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:35,100
prop. We accept username as a prom.

10
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:41,500
Right and the other thing is it should be rendering.

11
00:00:43,300 --> 00:00:46,900
Remember to use the proper function syntax.

12
00:00:47,900 --> 00:00:50,800
Obviously, it should be just returning the Avatar component

13
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:54,800
internally because ultimately this is what we're trying to

14
00:00:54,800 --> 00:01:01,100
do. The interesting thing is we want to pass additional data.

15
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:04,400
One to pass props to Avatar.

16
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:05,099
We want to pass.

17
00:01:05,099 --> 00:01:06,100
It's the source prompts.

18
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:11,900
The question is, how do we find out what the source is?

19
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:20,600
Right and let's just say So let's just say we have some.

20
00:01:24,300 --> 00:01:34,100
local state anxiety this component, which is URL And by default

21
00:01:34,100 --> 00:01:37,400
when we first load this component, we only have the username.

22
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:38,700
We don't have the URL yet.

23
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:43,700
And the requirement says we should wait.

24
00:01:43,700 --> 00:01:47,200
It's here Hey, where's the requirement?

25
00:01:47,300 --> 00:01:47,600
Okay.

26
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:48,100
It's here.

27
00:01:49,300 --> 00:01:50,800
It says before the API Returns.

28
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:52,800
The higher-order component should be passing a placeholder

29
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:54,800
URL to the inner component.

30
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:59,800
So we just copy that and use that as the default value for

31
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:07,900
our URL here, right and we'll just whatever we're just passing

32
00:02:07,900 --> 00:02:08,199
it in.

33
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:13,700
So now we first we've created a smart Avatar component not

34
00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:14,200
so smart.

35
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:17,000
It always just renders in Avatar with a placeholder image

36
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:21,600
and now we need to figure out how to find out where the real

37
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:22,500
URL is.

38
00:02:23,100 --> 00:02:25,500
So let's do that in a lifecycle hook.

39
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:29,000
So when the component is created we're going to call this

40
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
API. We're going to fetch URL.

41
00:02:33,700 --> 00:02:38,200
And because it's Express the username, we're just right we

42
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:41,500
caught it with the username and it accepts a callback which

43
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:43,800
gives you the URL that we need.

44
00:02:46,100 --> 00:02:51,700
in inside that call back or just set our URL to the correct

45
00:02:51,700 --> 00:03:05,600
URL all right, so does this make sense?

46
00:03:06,100 --> 00:03:11,200
So essentially we're maintaining an intermediate immediate

47
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:15,800
piece of state and this this state is the URL and it starts

48
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:19,600
with a placeholder and it's changed after we've fetched the

49
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:22,600
the desired URL from the API and all we're doing is just

50
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:25,700
passing it down to the inner Avatar component.

51
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:28,900
The good thing is we've extracted the piece of functionality

52
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:33,700
very cleanly out of the inner outer component into this thing.

53
00:03:34,900 --> 00:03:38,200
And I believe this should work.

54
00:03:38,300 --> 00:03:44,700
So it's better to just actually open it they are so this

55
00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:48,200
is the effect so it shows the placeholder then turns into

56
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:52,800
that. So imagine you can do something like a blurring effect

57
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:55,300
or initially showing some other things you can do a lot of

58
00:03:55,300 --> 00:03:58,900
fancy stuff in here, but the good thing is you can encapsulate

59
00:03:58,900 --> 00:04:01,300
all of that anxiety this higher order component.

60
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:03,000
It doesn't leak anywhere else.

61
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:05,600
So we're just really nice.

62
00:04:05,700 --> 00:04:10,700
So one small thing that we might want to think about is that

63
00:04:11,900 --> 00:04:15,300
it's this component currently is pretty unoptimized in the

64
00:04:15,300 --> 00:04:18,800
sense. It always hits the API whenever it's created, you

65
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:20,800
know, but we

66
00:04:20,900 --> 00:04:27,600
actually create something like a cash here that cash is the

67
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:31,100
user name and URL pairs so that we don't need to actually

68
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:35,000
hit the you hit the API all the time, you know, you can have

69
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:40,100
a cashier with a user name and URL payers and inside our

70
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:42,900
Data here.

71
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:48,100
We can directly start with a cached hit if it exists and

72
00:04:48,100 --> 00:04:49,300
we check again here.

73
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:53,000
If it's already a cache hit we don't even need to call the

74
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:53,800
API at all.

75
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:59,400
So you can do a lot of things optimizations fancy functionalities

76
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:04,300
anxiety here, but it doesn't affect the usage to the parent

77
00:05:04,300 --> 00:05:05,200
component at all.

78
00:05:05,700 --> 00:05:09,000
No matter what you do inside that component this parent component

79
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,300
use it stays the same this inner.

80
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:14,300
Opponents the Avatar component stayed the same.

81
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:18,400
They don't need to change right you can do all the work inside

82
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:23,100
your inner this higher order component, but you are not affecting

83
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:25,800
your parent your child.

84
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:29,300
So this is good because it shows that it has is it's a good

85
00:05:29,300 --> 00:05:33,300
encapsulation means the only interface we're using to talk

86
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:36,100
between the parent and the child is vir props.

87
00:05:36,900 --> 00:05:41,200
Because the the way we communicate is so constrained this

88
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:44,300
make ensures that changing the inner implementation of this

89
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:49,000
enhancer doesn't affect other pieces Parts in your codes.

90
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
This is critical.

91
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:53,900
If you have a large team large project and you want to make

92
00:05:53,900 --> 00:05:57,500
sure when you are changing things, you're not stepping on

93
00:05:57,500 --> 00:06:00,400
other people's toes and not accidentally breaking other things

94
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:06,600
and the trick to that is make sure this piece of codes by

95
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:10,000
Contracts with other parts of the code base is minimal.

96
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:11,400
In this case.

97
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:14,800
The only thing that it's connecting to other pieces in your

98
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:17,900
code are the incoming props and outgoing props.

99
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:22,200
So this is great because this is a very very clear constraint.

100
00:06:22,300 --> 00:06:23,300
It's very minimal.

101
00:06:23,700 --> 00:06:26,000
It gives you very little chance of breaking other people's

102
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,600
things in your render function there.

103
00:06:28,700 --> 00:06:29,999
You're referencing Avatar.

104
00:06:29,999 --> 00:06:32,400
Should you be actually referencing the inner components?

105
00:06:32,700 --> 00:06:33,100
Yes.

106
00:06:33,100 --> 00:06:35,000
That's a that's a mistake here.

107
00:06:36,300 --> 00:06:36,500
Yep.

108
00:06:36,900 --> 00:06:40,500
So yeah, this makes this with Avatar you are a more generic.

109
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:46,400
So any inner component that takes a URL props can be used

110
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:51,500
with this with Avatar URL thing and it can be more generic.

111
00:06:51,700 --> 00:06:55,500
For example, you can take something like you can even pass

112
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:59,000
the fetch URL function here, right?

113
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:02,900
So instead of hard-coded to always be fetching avatars, you

114
00:07:02,900 --> 00:07:06,500
can on the Fly customize what you're actually fetch.

115
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:08,500
It takes the username.

116
00:07:08,700 --> 00:07:11,000
You can fetch the Avatar you can fetch other information

117
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:14,500
about the user but you're using the same interface to enhance

118
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:18,800
inner components and this increases the reusability for this

119
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:19,700
enhancer as well.

120
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:23,300
What are the difference between created amounted hooks for

121
00:07:23,300 --> 00:07:24,100
fetching data?

122
00:07:27,300 --> 00:07:31,200
To be honest, the difference is is minimal.

123
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:35,300
The main difference is that mounted is called after the rendering

124
00:07:35,300 --> 00:07:39,200
happens and the dump actual Dom nodes are created.

125
00:07:40,700 --> 00:07:46,700
So technically created will be called earlier than your the

126
00:07:46,700 --> 00:07:52,000
mounted if your component takes, you know a long time to

127
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,500
render then create.

128
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:56,900
It might be called even earlier than mounted and it's good.

129
00:07:57,100 --> 00:08:01,100
To send the request out beforehand because the request needs

130
00:08:01,100 --> 00:08:03,800
to go through the internet and there's latency.

131
00:08:04,700 --> 00:08:07,400
So the latency can overlap with the time it takes to render

132
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:08,300
a component.

133
00:08:08,900 --> 00:08:12,100
So that's the main thing there was a there was an early question

134
00:08:12,100 --> 00:08:13,600
about slots.

135
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:17,700
It's I think it's actually easier to read the docs about

136
00:08:17,700 --> 00:08:24,900
slots, but slots API was actually derived from the same standard

137
00:08:24,900 --> 00:08:26,900
from w3c.

138
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:32,100
And so in web components, there's the slot mechanism and

139
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:36,100
Views implementation Loosely follows that the spec but we

140
00:08:36,100 --> 00:08:40,300
kind of enhance it in a few ways and most importantly view

141
00:08:40,300 --> 00:08:41,600
slot mechanism Works in rent.

142
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:48,800
As to so if you use a function that uses rendered functions,

143
00:08:49,300 --> 00:08:52,200
I use a component that uses random functions like this so

144
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:53,900
you can do slots equals Foo.

145
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:00,300
And the way to access this slot inside a random function

146
00:09:00,900 --> 00:09:04,900
is by doing this dollar slots Foo.

147
00:09:06,300 --> 00:09:09,500
This will give you an array of virtual nodes.

148
00:09:10,700 --> 00:09:14,100
That falls into the slot.

149
00:09:16,700 --> 00:09:20,100
Because this you can have multiple things that falls into

150
00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:21,000
the same slot.

151
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:25,700
So you get have an array and if you don't give it any slot

152
00:09:25,700 --> 00:09:32,800
name. Then all unnamed ones will be inside this daughter

153
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:34,100
slots the default.

154
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:37,700
This is also an array so you can like pass them directly

155
00:09:37,700 --> 00:09:38,800
as children.

156
00:09:41,100 --> 00:09:50,000
to this essentially you're passing on the slot content into

157
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:53,700
this inner component even better.

158
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,100
Well, yeah, this is a typical use case.

159
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,800
Another thing another trick that we can talk about is.

160
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:05,500
Inheriting the outer attributes.

161
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:08,700
So we have this higher order components like here.

162
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:12,400
If you do something like ID equals Foo, unfortunately, it

163
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:15,500
won't be passed down to the inner component because we didn't

164
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:19,700
explicitly list it but this ID will in fact be collected

165
00:10:19,700 --> 00:10:23,200
inside an attribute card a property called at this dollar

166
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:27,900
attrs. This is a new feature in two point four, which means

167
00:10:27,900 --> 00:10:32,000
you can pass it down like this.

168
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:39,800
So this way you're relaying all the additional attributes

169
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:41,300
down to the inner component.

170
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:45,600
So this ID will in fact now be rendered on the internal Avatar.

171
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:51,700
But the default behavior is only explicitly listed props

172
00:10:51,700 --> 00:10:52,700
will be passed down.

173
00:10:54,100 --> 00:10:57,000
This also means in created hook you cannot access Domino's.

174
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,200
That's correct.

175
00:10:58,300 --> 00:11:01,900
So the created hook only Mount Hood guarantees.

176
00:11:01,900 --> 00:11:05,500
The Dom has been created in created hook.

177
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:11,000
It means instance is created on the dock on the website.

178
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,600
There is a documentation.

179
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:21,600
life cycle diagram As you can see when the create a hook

180
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:25,500
is called we have initialized events lifecycle injections

181
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:26,400
and reactivity.

182
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:29,500
These are instance specific.

183
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:32,800
They don't have anything to do with the Dom or rendering

184
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:33,500
or anything.

185
00:11:35,700 --> 00:11:39,400
Real rendering only happens after create a hook has been

186
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:45,300
called and there could be on the fire compliation and then

187
00:11:45,300 --> 00:11:48,800
virtual Dom rendering and eventually when the actual Dom

188
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:50,000
has been created.

189
00:11:50,300 --> 00:11:51,900
That's when mounted will be called.

190
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:56,700
So now the component is considered to being mounted States.

191
00:11:58,100 --> 00:12:03,800
Off-topic question in new router could import food would

192
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:08,000
be changed to something like lazy and ports to get a slightly

193
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,500
simpler syntax.

194
00:12:12,700 --> 00:12:13,400
Not really.

195
00:12:15,100 --> 00:12:19,200
So the question is really about a sink components and code

196
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:20,300
splitting together.

197
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:25,500
I think this currency in Texas is already simple enough.

198
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:32,300
Introducing so the more important thing is the import syntax

199
00:12:32,300 --> 00:12:37,300
Dynamic import is a speck right arrow function is part of

200
00:12:37,300 --> 00:12:39,800
JavaScript Dynamic important part of JavaScript.

201
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:44,100
We're just using these standard language features for acing

202
00:12:44,100 --> 00:12:46,400
components and code splitting which in my opinion is better

203
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:50,100
than having to have a custom lazy import function, which

204
00:12:50,100 --> 00:12:54,700
is not part of the standard in my you know, Essentially,

205
00:12:54,700 --> 00:12:58,300
we're having a our own API instead of using standard language

206
00:12:58,300 --> 00:12:58,800
features.
