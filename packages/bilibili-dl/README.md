## Background

There are many videos without subtitles on [bilibili](https://www.bilibili.com/), which is difficult for someone (like me) to understand. So, i build this tool to download videos from bilibili and another tool [auto-add-subtitle](https://www.npmjs.com/package/auto-add-subtitle) to add subtitles for videos i downloaded.
